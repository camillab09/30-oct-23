//order of operations- multiply and divide are done first

// + - * / are called operators
//parentheses () have higher precedence
//than all other operators except for unary operators (++) -- ++
//Whole numbers are called integers
//decimals are called floating point numbers, or floats. Computers have issues
//with floats. Calculation with floats is somtimes inaccurate, so best
//practice for adding currency is breaking it down (to Ã¸re or cent and multiply)
//Math.round() will round the number up or down to the closest integer.
//((2095 + 799) * 0.1) / 100
//javascript will calculate the inner brackets first, and the outer brackets
//second.
//Math.round((2095 + 799) * 0.1) / 100
//this will round the amount to the nearest cent.
